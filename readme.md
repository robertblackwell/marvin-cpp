## So what is this ?
MarvinCpp (or marvin++ as it will soon be called) is a project that is aimed at being a man-in-the-middle proxy; that is another attempt at a __Charles__ equivalent.

Unlike my project called __marvin__ (https://github.com/robertblackwell/marvin.git  which is an earlier effort at a mitm proxy iin node-js), this one is more ambitious, written in C++ using Boost/Asio.

__Note__ in recent months i have moved the wortk on this project from Osx to Ubuntu and so now I am considering how I would deploy it on Linux.

## Status

The CORVID-19 lockdown of 2020 has given me the opportunity to invest some time in this project and as of April 2020 the basic structure of the Mitm Proxy is now in place and is able to intercept and view __HTTP__ and __HTTPS__ traffic.

However it is still not a deployable app.
