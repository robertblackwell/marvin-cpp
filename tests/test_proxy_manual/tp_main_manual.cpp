/**
 * This is the simplest possible test of the http mitm proxy. To run it needs manual intervention.
 * After starting execution of tp_proxy_simple executable the program will hang waiting for
 * http traffic to be proxied through localhost:9992
 *
 * Such traffic can be generated by running the script curl.sh that resides in the
 * tests/test_proxy_alone directory.
 *
 * If you have cloned this project from github you will need to modify the curl.sh script
 * to access a different url as the one that comes in the script is local to my development
 * system.
 *
 * Each time you run curl.sh the traffic between the curl.sh script and the url/server
 * will be displayed on stdout.
 *
 * Inspect that traffic to satisfy yourself that the traffic is being correctly captured.
 *
 * This test can also be used to demonstrate https tunneling. Once the etst is running execute
 * the shell script curl_tunnel.sh
 *
 * This will do a get request against www.bankofamerica.com. You will see the response to this request
 * on the shell scripts stdout  - demonstrating that the proxy connected, passed the request and received and passed on the
 * response.
 * You will aslo see on the proxies stdout "Connect Request" which is all that is passed to the collector when a tunnel
 * connection is made.
