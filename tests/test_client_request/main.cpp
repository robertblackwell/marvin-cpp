//
// This file makes multiple parallel requests to the same host and checks that
// each reply corresponds to the request. That is ensures no "mixing up".
//
// Note the requests go to a local private host that has been programmed
// specifically for this test
//
// Primarily this is a test of the Request object and uses Request in it's
// simplest for - that is sending an entire http message in one hit and with
// no body.
//
// Consider running this test with different Connection management strategies
// to see whether we can save on "async_connect" calls and maybe even get some
// pipe-lining
