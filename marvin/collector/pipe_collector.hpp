/// An instance is used to funnel a copy of the traffic seen by a mitm proxy to a named pipe where it can
/// be read by whatever program one wants to use to display such traffic.
///
/// This class is a singleton that requires to be primed with the servers io_service object so that
/// it (this class) can schedule callbacks. I chose to have the io_service passed in the getInstance
/// static method, that way I cannot forget to pass it.
///
/// In addition it needs the path name of the pipe to which it will write. That pipe name should be set via the static method
/// configSet_PipePath during the startup phase of the server. 
/// Note the creation of a PipeCollector instance will fail if there pipe does not exist or does not have a reader attached.
///
/// The indirect setting of the pipe name is a bit of a problem and I should probably have made the name an argument to the
/// getInstance() method (or at least had a variant that takes the pipe name)
///
/// This class also has a boost strand to protect against mutiple access to critical sections of code.
/// This class also does synchronous stream IO which will delay whatever thread the strand is running on
/// To prevent this delaying the entire proxy process the server should start an additional thread and connect it
/// to the general io_service to aleviate this issue.
