/**
* \ingroup Client
* \brief This class implements an http client that can send a request message and wait for a response.
*
* Two modes of transmission operation are provided for:
*
*   -   send the entire request in a single call using asyncWrite. This mode is best when
*       either there is NO message body or the entire message body is available at the time
*       the request transmission is started. In this mode the handler provided to asyncWrite
*       is passed a complete response including any body data.
*
*   -   send the request/message piecemeal - headers, followed by multiple chunks of body, followed by trailers.
*       This mode is intended to handle streaming of the body data to avoid latency or buffering large body. In this
*       mode the handler for the incoming response message is provide by the setOnResponseHandler. The response handler
*       should be set before any transmission is started. A complete response including body data is provided
*       to this handler.
*
* Two constructors are provided
*   -   one will construct a non-connected client for which an explicit or implicit
*       connect call will be required.
*   -   the other creates a client with an established connection.
*
* Handlers or callbacks
*
